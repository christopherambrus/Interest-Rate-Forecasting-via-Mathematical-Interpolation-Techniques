# Interest-Rate-Forecasting-via-Mathematical-Interpolation-Techniques
Explored various interpolation methods to enhance interest rate forecasting from the Vasicek model. The project  compared cubic splines, Lagrange and Newton polynomials, and regression analysis, building a yield curve and  identifying the most precise technique to improve the predictive power of the Vasicek SDE.
